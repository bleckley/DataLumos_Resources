# Getting Started Downloading Government Data and Archiving with DataLumos

## Introduction
This guide is intended to provide users with an overview of how to begin efforts to save government data resources and archive them with DataLumos.

## Search for the Data
When starting out in your effort to preserve government data, the first step is to search for the data. Ask yourself questions like these:
1. What datasets am I interested in? Is there a specific topic, or are you just interested in ensuring that government data? If it's the latter, you can [contact DataLumos](https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/contact) for ideas on data which may be of interest.
2. Where does the dataset currently exist? Is it publicly available on a government website?
3. Is it already archived somewhere? When you search for it online, do you find sites other than original source? Is that site dependable to preserve the data in the long-term? Is it already archived at DataLumos ([search DataLumos's current holdings to find out](https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/search/studies)).
